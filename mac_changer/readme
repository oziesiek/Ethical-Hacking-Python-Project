# MAC Address Changer - For Educational Purposes Only

Warning: This repository contains a Python script designed for educational purposes only. The purpose of this script is to demonstrate how to change the MAC address of a network interface. Changing the MAC address without proper authorization from the network owner is illegal and unethical. It is essential to use this script responsibly and only on networks and devices that you own or have explicit permission to modify.

## Disclaimer

The following Python script is for educational and learning purposes only. Unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or any form of unauthorized MAC address modification is illegal and unethical. The creator of this repository does not promote or condone any illegal or malicious activities.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase how to change the MAC address of a network interface using a Python script. The script allows you to specify the target network interface and the new MAC address. It then utilizes the "ifconfig" command-line utility to modify the MAC address.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the Python `optparse` library to parse command-line arguments and obtain the target interface (`-i`) and the new MAC address (`-m`) from the user.

2. The `get_current_mac()` function retrieves the current MAC address of the specified interface using the "ifconfig" command.

3. The `change_mac()` function changes the MAC address of the specified interface using the "ifconfig" command with the new MAC address provided by the user.

4. The script displays the current MAC address, changes the MAC address to the new value, and then verifies if the MAC address was successfully changed.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Python script, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. This script uses the built-in Python libraries `subprocess`, `optparse`, and `re` and does not require any additional installations.

Please note that the MAC Address Changer script is designed for Unix-like systems, such as Linux or macOS, as it relies on the "ifconfig" command-line utility, which is specific to these systems.

## Ethical Use

Using this script to change the MAC address of networks or devices you do not own or without explicit permission from the network owner is considered unethical and illegal. Ethical hackers, cybersecurity professionals, and network administrators may use such tools responsibly and with proper authorization for legitimate network diagnostics, security analysis, or penetration testing on networks they are authorized to test.

## Responsible Use

Always ensure that you have explicit authorization from the network owner before using any tool to modify network settings. Unauthorized access or network modifications without proper permission can lead to severe legal consequences.

## Contribution

If you are interested in contributing to the field of cybersecurity, consider focusing on responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities, participating in bug bounty programs, and contributing to legitimate cybersecurity research. Engaging in legal and ethical practices will help create a safer and more secure digital environment.

## Disclaimer

The creator of this repository is not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by the use of this script. Use it responsibly, legally, and with explicit permission from the network owner.

Happy learning, and remember to stay ethical and secure!
