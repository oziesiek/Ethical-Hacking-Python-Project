# File Replacement Attack

This repository contains a Python script for performing a File Replacement Attack using the netfilterqueue and scapy libraries. The attack intercepts HTTP traffic, searches for requests for ".exe" files, and replaces the requested files with a 301 Moved Permanently response, redirecting the target to a specified URL.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:

pip install netfilterqueue
pip install scapy

Usage
Setting up iptables: Before running the script, make sure to set up iptables to redirect the packets to the netfilterqueue. Execute the following commands:

iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
Running the script: To use the File Replacement Attack script, execute it with the following command:

python replace_downloads.py

Functionality
The script intercepts packets using the netfilterqueue and scapy, and it identifies HTTP requests for ".exe" files on port 80. Upon detection, it performs a file replacement attack by modifying the packet payload and sending a 301 Moved Permanently response, redirecting the target to a specified URL (http:/your_exploit_server/evil.exe).

Warning
Performing file replacement attacks can lead to legal consequences and is considered an unethical practice. This script is provided for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly and with explicit permission on networks that you own or have authorization to test.
