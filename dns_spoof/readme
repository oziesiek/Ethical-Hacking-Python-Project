# DNS Spoofing

This repository contains a Python script for performing DNS (Domain Name System) spoofing attack on a target machine. The DNS spoofing attack redirects the target's DNS requests for a specific domain (e.g., www.bing.com) to a different IP address, causing the target to be redirected to a spoofed website.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:

pip install netfilterqueue
pip install scapy

Usage
Setting up iptables: Before running the script, make sure to set up iptables to redirect the DNS packets to the netfilterqueue. Execute the following commands:

iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
Running the script: To use the DNS Spoofing script, execute it with the following command:

python dns_spoofing.py

Functionality
The script intercepts DNS packets using the netfilterqueue and checks if they are DNS response packets (scapy.DNSRR). If the DNS response packet is for the domain "www.bing.com" (you can change this to any other domain), it will be spoofed, and the target will be redirected to the IP address "192.168.120.128" (you can modify this to your desired IP address).

Warning
DNS spoofing is a powerful attack technique, and using it without permission on unauthorized networks or domains can lead to severe consequences. Please use this script responsibly and only on networks and domains that you own or have explicit authorization to test.
