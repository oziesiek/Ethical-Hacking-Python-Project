python ssh_bruteforce.py <host> -u <username> -P <password_list_file>
<host>: The hostname or IP address of the target SSH server.
-u <username>: The username to be used for the bruteforce attempt.
-P <password_list_file>: Path to a file containing a list of passwords, with each password on a new line.
