# WiFi Password Extractor - For Educational Purposes Only

Warning: This repository contains a Python script designed for educational purposes only. The purpose of this script is to showcase how a WiFi password extractor works. It is essential to use this script responsibly and ethically. Using this script or similar tools to extract WiFi passwords from networks you do not own or have explicit permission to access is illegal and unethical.

## Disclaimer

The following Python script is for educational and learning purposes only. Unauthorized access to computer systems or networks, including extracting WiFi passwords, is illegal and unethical. The creator of this repository does not promote or condone any illegal or malicious activities.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how a WiFi password extractor works. The script leverages the Windows command-line utility "netsh" to retrieve WiFi network information, including the clear-text passwords.

## How It Works

1. The script uses the Python `subprocess` module to run the command-line utility "netsh."

2. The command `netsh wlan show profile WiFi key=clear` retrieves information about WiFi profiles, where "WiFi" represents the name of the specific WiFi network. The `key=clear` parameter reveals the clear-text password of the network.

3. The script captures the output of the executed command, which includes the WiFi network name and its corresponding clear-text password.

4. The extracted WiFi network names and passwords are then sent via email to a specified email address using the `smtplib` module.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Python script, ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install smtplib
