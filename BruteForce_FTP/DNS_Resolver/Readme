# DNS Lookup Tool

This Python script performs DNS lookups for a target domain and specified record types. It uses the `dns.resolver` module to resolve DNS records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required Python packages using:
  pip install dnspython

Usage
Clone the repository
Run the script
python dns.py

Follow the prompts to enter the target domain and record types.

For record types, you can either provide a space-separated list (e.g., "A AAAA MX") or press Enter for the default list ("A AAAA CNAME MX NS SOA TXT").
View the results.

The script will display the resolved DNS records for the specified domain and record types.
