# Wireless Deauthentication Attack

This Python script utilizes Scapy to perform a deauthentication attack on a target device by sending de-authentication frames to the router. This can be used for educational purposes, including ethical hacking and network security testing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy

Install the required Python packages:
pip install scapy

Usage
Open the deauther.py file.

Replace the target_mac and gateway_mac variables with the MAC addresses of the target device and the router, respectively.

# Replace these with the MAC addresses of your target and gateway
target_mac = "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"  # Replace with the target device's MAC address
gateway_mac = "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF"  # Replace with the router's MAC address
Save the file.

Run the script:
python deauther.py

Obtaining Router MAC Address
To obtain the MAC address of your router, you can follow these steps:
Open a terminal and run the following command to list your network interfaces:
ifconfig
Identify the interface connected to your router (e.g., wlan0 for Wi-Fi).
Run the following command to view the details of the selected interface:
iw dev [your_interface] link
Replace [your_interface] with the actual interface name.
Look for the "Connected to" field. The MAC address next to it is the MAC address of your router.

Configuration
Network Interface: Set the correct network interface name (e.g., wlan0, eth0) in the iface variable.
# Network interface name
iface = "wlan0"
                                                 
Deauthentication Count: You can adjust the number of deauthentication frames sent by modifying the count variable in the script.
# Number of deauthentication frames to send
count = 100
