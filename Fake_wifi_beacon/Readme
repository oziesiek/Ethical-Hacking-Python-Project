# Wireless Beacon Sender

This Python script utilizes Scapy to send wireless beacon frames, simulating multiple access points. It can be used for educational purposes, including ethical hacking and network security testing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- Faker

Install the required Python packages:
pip install scapy faker

Usage
Open the beacon.py file.
Replace the sender_mac variable with the desired MAC address for the sender.
Adjust other parameters or settings in the script if needed.


Copy code
# Replace this with the desired MAC address for the sender
sender_mac = "your_desired_mac_address"
Save the file.

Run the script:
python send_beacon.py

Configuration
Number of Access Points: You can configure the number of simulated access points by modifying the n_ap variable in the script.
# Number of access points to simulate
n_ap = 5
Network Interface: Set the correct network interface name (e.g., wlan0, eth0) in the iface variable.
# Network interface name
iface = "your_network_interface"
