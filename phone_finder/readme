# Phone Number Information Lookup

This Python script allows you to retrieve detailed information about a phone number using the `phonenumbers` library. It provides insights such as the country, region, carrier, time zone, validity, and the formatted version of the phone number. This script is useful for verifying phone numbers and gathering essential information for various applications, including customer service, fraud detection, and geographical analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `phonenumbers` library (install using `pip install phonenumbers`)

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the `phonenumbers` library installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

   ```
   pip install phonenumbers
   ```

2. Copy and paste the script into a Python file (e.g., `phone_number_info.py`).

3. Modify the `phone_number` variable in the script with the desired phone number in E.164 format (e.g., `"+00123456789"`).

4. Run the script using the command: `python phone_number_info.py`

## How to Use

When you run the script with a valid phone number, it will use the `phonenumbers` library to gather the following information:

- **Country:** The country where the phone number is registered.
- **Region:** The specific region or area within the country.
- **Carrier:** The name of the mobile carrier associated with the phone number.
- **Time Zone:** The time zone(s) corresponding to the phone number's location.
